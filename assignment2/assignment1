assignment 2:
- experiment with different levels of gaussian noise

q1.1(10 points):
- zero padding -- done
- convolution forward -- done
- convolution backward wrt W -- done
- convolution backward wrt X -- larger or equal, some conditional, check with others
- pooling backward -- corresponding value in grad pool where the max value, and zero otherwise. 

#############
vanilla CNN's
#############

report the test accuracies of ResNet-18 on the four provided corruption functions for different severities ( 1 to 5 ) (8 points)
- gaussian noise
- gaussian blur
- contrast reduction
- JPEG compression

+ test accuracy on the original test dataset
!plot all accuracies with accuracy at the y-axis and severity on the x-axis

+ redo experiments(7 points);
- VGG-11
- VGG-11 w\ batch normalization
- ResNet-34
- DenseNet-121

?for all different severities

-- metrics; CE and RCE
! compare network architectures
:"deeper models, more regularization? batch normalization, less internal covariance shift?"
