assignment 2:
- experiment with different levels of gaussian noise

q1.1(10 points):
- zero padding -- done
- convolution forward -- done
- convolution backward wrt W -- done
- convolution backward wrt X -- larger or equal, some conditional, check with others
- pooling backward -- corresponding value in grad pool where the max value, and zero otherwise.

report the test accuracies of ResNet-18 on the four provided corruption functions for different severities ( 1 to 5 ) (8 points)
- gaussian noise - done (15 epochs)
- gaussian blur - done
- contrast reduction - done
- JPEG compression - done

+ test accuracy on the original test dataset - done
!plot all accuracies with accuracy at the y-axis and severity on the x-axis

+ redo experiments(7 points);
- VGG-11
- VGG-11 w\ batch normalization
- ResNet-34
- DenseNet-121

#############
add loop for different architectures -- done
compute CE and RCE with computed test accuracies -- solve problem of model not converging
plot results
 - read csv files: plot test accuracies of resnet18 
	- for different corruption functions
	- for different severities
	- for different models, excluding vgg11_bn??

compute CE and RCE for different models
- Explain the trend you observe when comparing network architectures, 
- deeper models, and using Batch Normalization.
